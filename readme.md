A very simplistic and quick program I wrote to calculate the typical costs for a given amount of usage, rate and period of time.
Please note - take the output figures with a pinch of salt and ensure to check them manually if they seem off.
There may be numerical errors due to rounding (or mistakes I made in the code).
I make absolutely no claim that this program is fit for any use whatsoever, you may get incorrect results and thus, you use the results at your own risk.

Please feel free to suggest improvements, if there is something wrong with the code I would very much appreciate it if you could point it out.

Thanks, Best Regards
